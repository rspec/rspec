## 🚨 AI Policy & Operations

Extracted from CONTRIBUTING.md - operational constraints and procedures.

### Key Requirements

- If you need help getting started, check out the [DEVELOPMENT](DEVELOPMENT.md) file for steps that will get you up and running.
- will require cross repository changes.

### Development Procedures

- We welcome contributions from *everyone*. While contributing, please follow the project [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), so that everyone can be included.
- by adding a failing test for reproducible [reported bugs](https://github.com/rspec/rspec/issues)
- should not be too hard to pull off.
- test case. To make this process easier, we have prepared one basic
- When submitting your code for review, we ask that you get a passing build (green CI).



## 🏗️ Architecture & Context Guide

This section provides architectural context and agent-understanding for the codebase.

### Prerequisites

- **Ruby:** 2.7+ (or applicable language version)
- **Package Manager:** Bundler
- **Test Runner:** RSpec



### Project Structure

```
rspec/
├── src/                  # Source code
├── tests/                # Test suite (24 files)
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

### Architecture Overview

#### Key Components
- **Main Entry:** Standard layout
- **Test Suite:** 24 test files
- **Build Configuration:** Standard

#### Design Principles

1. **Modularity** - Code organized by functionality with clear separation of concerns
2. **Testability** - Comprehensive test coverage across critical paths
3. **Clarity** - Explicit naming and structure for AI agent understanding
4. **Consistency** - Uniform patterns and conventions throughout codebase
5. **Maintainability** - Well-documented code with clear intent

### Directory Map

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| `src/` or project root | Main source code |
| `tests/` or `test/` | Test suite |


### Development Workflow

#### Initial Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/rspec.git
cd rspec
bundle install
```

#### Development Commands

**Running Tests:**
```bash
bundle exec rspec         # Run RSpec tests
bundle exec rspec spec/   # Run specific directory
bundle exec rspec -v      # Verbose output
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
bundle exec rubocop       # Lint with RuboCop
bundle exec rubocop -a    # Auto-fix issues
```

### Code Style & Conventions

- **Naming:** Use Ruby conventions (snake_case for functions, PascalCase for classes)
- **Type Hints:** No (strongly encouraged)
- **Error Handling:** No - handle errors at boundaries; let exceptions propagate when another layer owns recovery
- **Logging:** No
- **Testing:** Yes - write tests alongside code changes

### Testing Strategy

**Framework:** RSpec
**Test Files:** 24 found

Before committing:
1. Run the full test suite: `bundle exec rspec`
2. Run specific test directory: `bundle exec rspec spec/`
3. Lint with RuboCop: `bundle exec rubocop`
4. Auto-fix issues: `bundle exec rubocop -a`

### Writing Documentation

When updating docs:
1. Always include explanatory text before code snippets
2. Describe *why* and *what* before showing *how*
3. Keep sections focused on a single concept
4. Use clear, concrete examples

### Contributing Guidelines

This project has a detailed contribution guide at **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**.

**Key Requirements:**
- Review the contribution guide for all requirements
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Ensure alignment with project's contribution policies

### Common Patterns

When contributing to this project:
1. Read existing code in the area you're modifying
2. Follow the established patterns and style
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
5. Add docstrings for public APIs
6. Update tests when changing behavior

### What We Value

✅ Well-tested code with clear intent
✅ Consistent code style and naming conventions
✅ Code that is easy for AI agents to understand
✅ Clear, descriptive commit messages
✅ Modular, reusable components
✅ Comprehensive documentation

### What We Avoid

❌ Large functions doing multiple things
❌ Commented-out dead code
❌ Inconsistent naming or patterns
❌ Unclear error messages
❌ Unexplained magic numbers or strings
❌ Skipped tests or test TODOs

### AI Readiness Dimensions (Scoring)

This project is evaluated across 8 dimensions:

1. **Architecture** (10/100) - Code organization and modularity
2. **Testing** (15/100) - Test coverage and quality
3. **Dependencies** (6/100) - Dependency management
4. **Conventions** (0/100) - Consistent patterns
5. **Entry Points** (4/100) - Clear main/start locations
6. **Security** (5/100) - Input validation and error handling
7. **Build** (5/100) - Clear build/setup instructions
8. **Documentation** (8/100) - Code and project documentation

### Next Steps

Before making changes:
1. Read relevant source files to understand the existing code
2. Look at existing tests for similar functionality
3. Follow the patterns you see in the codebase
4. Write tests for your changes
5. Run `pytest` to verify nothing breaks
6. Run code quality checks: `ruff check . && mypy .`
7. Format your code: `ruff format .`
